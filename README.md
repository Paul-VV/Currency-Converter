# Currency-Converter
An e-cornell certificate project containing a program that converts currency with a given API key for converted concurrent exchange rates.

Most specifications/pseudocode are outlined by e-cornell

This tool involves three files: 

1. currency.py = the module that includes backend functionality
2. testcurrency.py = the test cases for the currency functions
3. exchangeit.py = the interactive script that allows the conversions between two currencies, mainly for non-programmers

Prerequisites:

- A CLI terminal that has Python installed
- A web service for the live currency exchange rates
- An API key from an exchange rate web service
- Installing all three project files (the test currency script is optional, if testing is involved)
- Make sure the module introcs from the Cornell library is installed (pip install introcs, if this command dosen't work, then use python -m pip install introcs)

Instructions:

1. Install currency.py, exchangeit.py, and introcs (pip install introcs, if this command dosen't work, then use python -m pip install introcs)
2. Ensure that currency.py includes the web service address in the service_response function, and include the API key at the top the script
3. Open a CLI terminal and input the Python start up command with exchangeit.py alongside it (so '>> python exchangeit.py')
4. Follow along with the prompts to get a desired conversion
