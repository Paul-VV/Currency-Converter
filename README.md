# Currency-Converter
An e-cornell project containing a program that converts currency with a given API key for converted concurrent exchange rates.

This tool involves three files: 

1. currency.py = the module that includes backend functionality
2. testcurrency.py = the test cases for the currency functions
3. exchangeit.py = the interactive script that allows the conversions between two currencies, mainly for non-programmers

Prerequisites:

- A CLI terminal that has Python installed
- A web service for the live currency exchange rates
- An API key from an exchange rate web service
- Installing all three project files (the test currency script is optional, if testing is involved)
